# 🧠 SignBridge – AI-Powered Communication Platform

**SignBridge** is a real-time, AI-driven communication platform that bridges the gap between **spoken language, sign language, and emotional context** using open-source, locally hosted AI models.
It is designed for accessibility, inclusivity, and offline functionality — empowering individuals who rely on sign language or non-verbal communication to interact seamlessly with others and with digital systems.

---

## 🌉 Concept Overview

SignBridge acts as a **multimodal translator** between gesture, voice, text, and emotional cues.
It enables two-way communication between sign language users and speakers, ensuring understanding even across communication barriers.
The platform intelligently analyzes visual gestures, facial expressions, and vocal signals, converting them into coherent text, audio, or visual responses — entirely processed locally without cloud dependencies.

---

## ⚙️ Core Features

### 1. 🖐️ Gesture Recognition

* Uses **MediaPipe Holistic** to extract landmarks from the user’s hands, body, and face.
* Feeds the processed landmarks into a **TensorFlow Lite gesture classification model**.
* Recognizes a range of common sign gestures such as “HELLO,” “THANK YOU,” “YES,” “NO,” and “PLEASE.”
* Provides real-time gesture-to-text translation displayed within the user interface.
* Works fully offline and lightweight, suitable for edge deployment (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Jetson).

---

### 2. 😊 Emotion Recognition

* Detects **facial expressions** and micro-movements using camera input.
* Analyzes emotional states such as happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, or neutrality.
* Supports adaptive responses — e.g., adjusting speech tone or providing visual empathy cues.
* Enables emotionally aware interactions, enhancing clarity and empathy in communication.

---

### 3. 🎙️ Speech Recognition (ASR)

* Converts spoken audio into text using an open-source model such as **VOSK**.
* Functions entirely offline — no internet or cloud API required.
* Supports multiple languages and accent variations.
* Enables non-signers to speak naturally while the system transcribes and relays the text or gesture response.

---

### 4. 🔊 Text-to-Speech (TTS)

* Synthesizes natural speech from text using **pyttsx3** for local processing.
* Responds with spoken output in conversational tone.
* Allows sign language users to “speak” using recognized gestures that the system vocalizes.

---

### 5. 🧩 LangFlow Orchestration

* The AI workflow is fully visualized and orchestrated via **LangFlow**, connecting all modules:

  * Gesture → Text
  * Emotion → Context Adjuster
  * ASR → Text Parser
  * Text → TTS
* Ensures modular expandability: any open-source model can replace an existing block without architectural change.
* Exports the entire flow (`flow_export.yaml`) for reproducibility and transparency.

---

### 6. 🧬 Audio Hashing & Traceability

* Implements a **cryptographic audio hashing** feature to uniquely identify each input.
* Ensures verifiable evidence and traceability for recorded communications.
* Enables auditability and trust in accessibility applications or AI-mediated conversations.

---

### 7. 💬 Real-Time WebSocket Communication

* A lightweight **FastAPI + WebSocket backend** supports live bi-directional communication.
* The frontend streams gesture, voice, and emotion data simultaneously.
* Supports live sessions where gestures and speech are transcribed and played back with near-zero latency.

---

### 8. 🧠 Contextual AI Layer

* An intelligent reasoning layer interprets gesture and emotion data together to infer **context** (e.g., politeness, urgency, affirmation).
* Can adapt responses dynamically — for instance, toning down TTS output if the user appears upset.
* Optional integration with local LLMs (e.g., Llama.cpp) for natural-language contextualization.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

**Frontend (React)**

* Captures webcam and microphone streams.
* Sends encoded frames and audio data to the backend through WebSocket channels.
* Displays recognized gestures, transcribed text, and emotions in real time.

**Backend (FastAPI)**

* Manages the ASR, gesture, emotion, and TTS pipelines.
* Provides `/api` endpoints for discrete tasks (hashing, metadata, etc.) and `/ws` for live interaction.
* All inference is performed locally for privacy and offline functionality.

**LangFlow Integration**

* Visual orchestration of the end-to-end workflow (data flow, model invocation, output fusion).
* Each functional component (gesture recognition, ASR, emotion analysis, TTS) is a connected node in the LangFlow graph.

## 🔒 Design Philosophy

1. **Offline-First** – No cloud APIs; fully functional without an internet connection.
2. **Open-Source Stack** – Every model and library used is community-driven and locally hosted.
3. **Accessibility Focused** – Designed to empower sign language users and promote inclusive communication.
4. **Lightweight** – Optimized for CPU inference and minimal dependencies, runnable on modest hardware.
5. **Modular and Extensible** – Each AI module can be replaced or upgraded independently.
